   <h2><strong>Info</strong></h2>
   <p>Ark: Survival Evolved was released as a full game on PC, Mac, PS4, and Xbox on August 29, 2017 and released later on more platforms. A main feature of Ark is that it is in prehistoric times and the animals reflect that. The game includes over 80 creatures spread throughout the land, air, and sea. You are able to tame many of these creatures to assist you with travel, carrying items, or whatever you need. There are also different phases to the game. You start out in the stone phase, using stone tools and having a stone base. Then, after playing for a while, you move into the metal phase, using metal tools and armor, and having a base made out of metal. Finally, the end game phase is the tek(purposely misspelled) phase. This phase is the most difficult to reach and takes a very long time to do so. However, once you do achieve the tek phase you can rule the map with highly advanced weapons, armor, and bases. Ark not only has several vast and interesting maps for you to play on, you can also play on a procedurally generated map, meaning that the landscape is random and different than every other map. The maps' original release dates in chronological order are:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>The Island - June, 2015(Original map)</li>
       <li>The Center - May, 2016(Free DLC, released during early access)</li>

     </ol>
